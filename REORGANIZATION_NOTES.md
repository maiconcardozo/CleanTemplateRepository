# üìÅ Repository Structure Update

## Summary

The repository has been reorganized for better organization and cleaner navigation.

## Changes Made

### Scripts Moved
All build and test scripts have been moved from the root directory to `scripts/`:

**Old location:**
```bash
./build.sh
./run-tests.sh
./test.sh
```

**New location:**
```bash
scripts/build.sh
scripts/run-tests.sh
scripts/test.sh
```

### Documentation Organized
Status and summary documents moved to `docs/status/`:

**Moved files:**
- `FIX_SUMMARY.md` ‚Üí `docs/status/FIX_SUMMARY.md`
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` ‚Üí `docs/status/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
- `IMPROVEMENTS.md` ‚Üí `docs/status/IMPROVEMENTS.md`
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` ‚Üí `docs/status/PROJECT_STATUS.md`
- `TESTING_SUMMARY.md` ‚Üí `docs/status/TESTING_SUMMARY.md`

## What You Need to Update

### If you have local scripts or documentation that reference the old paths:

1. **Update script calls:**
   ```bash
   # Old
   ./build.sh verify
   
   # New
   scripts/build.sh verify
   ```

2. **Update documentation links:**
   ```markdown
   # Old
   [Status](PROJECT_STATUS.md)
   
   # New
   [Status](docs/status/PROJECT_STATUS.md)
   ```
